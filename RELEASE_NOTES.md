# RYVYNN v8.0 — “Breakthrough From Darkness”

**Date:** November 2025  
**Maintainer:** AONIXX / Shawn Michael Lutz  
**Scope:** New cinematic entry experience for the RYVYNN ecosystem

## Summary
This release introduces a front-facing, story-driven experience that visually represents RYVYNN’s core motto: “From our darkest hours to our brightest days.” It is designed to run on the same infrastructure as the canonical RYVYNN build (v7.1.0-official) and to hand users into the main app.

## What’s New
- Cinematic hero screen with raven/sacred-geometry styling  
- Guided 3-step transformation block  
- CTA to main RYVYNN app  
- Optional Stripe monetization hook (reuse existing price IDs)  
- Shared Supabase session for seamless handoff  
- Dark, cyber-sacred aesthetic aligned with AONIXX

## Compatibility
- Built on Next.js 15 App Router  
- Compatible with existing Supabase project  
- Deployable to Vercel as a separate project  
- No breaking changes to v7.1.0 canonical core

## Canonical Note
This is an **experience-layer release**, not a replacement for the v7.1.0 canonical RYVYNN Enterprise Build.  
v7.1.0 remains the system of record for app features, auth, and payments.
